         <p><strong>Fluffy dogs</strong> have been capturing hearts and imaginations for centuries. Big or small, non-shedding or quite the opposite, there’s a fluffy dog breed out there for practically everyone.</p>
          
          <p>Among the <em>fluffiest and cuddliest dog</em> breeds are the:</p>

          </ul>    
          
         
          
          <p>Teacup dogs are extremely popular pets because these micro dogs look like puppies forever. It's no wonder they can fetch thousands of dollars apiece. In general, teacups are markedly smaller than their breed standard and are not recognized by the <em>American Kennel Club</em>. Ethics come into question with these dogs since, in most cases, they are the runts or weakest of their litter and then are usually bred with other smaller or weaker dogs.</p>

                <h3>"Pomeranian puppy</h3>
                <p>Although today's Pomeranians have a reputation as <em>lapdogs</em>, they were originally bred to herd animals and pull sleds. Earlier versions of the Pomeranian breed weighed around 30 pounds. In the 1800s, they were bred to be smaller to be kept as companions rather than working dogs. Since then, they've only gotten smaller. </p>

                <h3>Poodle</h3>
                
                <p>Known for their <strong>intelligence, <em>athleticism</em>, and sociability</strong>, poodles make amazing family dogs. Teacup poodles usually weigh about 4 pounds, while their standard-sized counterparts weigh 45 to 70 pounds. One convenient trait of poodles? They're low-shedders. Their <em>curled coats</em> don't drop much hair, which is great news for your allergies and your vacuum cleaner. </p>

                <h3>Beagle</h3>
                <p>What they lack in size, teacup beagles make up for in <em>friendliness</em> and <em>energy</em>. Most of these beagles only weigh around 15 pounds, which is relatively large for a teacup dog. They can be <strong>stubborn</strong> when it comes to obedience. But they respond well <em>when you make training fun with treats and games</em>.</p>
